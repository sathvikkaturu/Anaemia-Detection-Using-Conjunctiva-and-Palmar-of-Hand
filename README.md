# Anaemia-Detection-Using-Conjunctiva-and-Palmar-of-Hand

Developed this project using CNN and SVM architectures by collecting the data of conjunctiva part of the eye and palmar of
the hand. On training, the model is able to differentiate the patients who are anaemic and non-anaemic.
For the anaemia project, we first preprocessed the images using CNN and converted them into a lower size with
much more efficient data of images and flattened them linear to fed the data to the SVM
